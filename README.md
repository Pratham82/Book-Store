# Book-Store

I have create a inventory system like CRUD application where we can store information about the books and the information will persists even if we refresh the page that is possible because of the local storage. And for styling I've used skeleton CSS.

I have added 2  versions of app.js where one is created with older JS and another one is created with newer ES6 function.
